Initial Design and Functionality: Fazlur Rahman

I, Alliyah Zulueta made some changes to the initial design such as css and added the age input section to the web page, allowing users to input their age dynamically. Additionally, I implemented the corresponding JavaScript functionality to add candles based on the entered age.
